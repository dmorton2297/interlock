# My Five Takeaways for 2020 - November, 2020 - Chicago, IL
---
## A Software Engineer
Graduating from Purdue University in May 2019 with a degree in Computer Science, I was eager to begin my career as a software engineer. I felt that my education had prepared me well for starting my first job. I landed an opportunity at West Monroe Partners in Chicago, IL, where I currently work. 

There were a few things I wish I was able to tell myself before starting.  Being a good "coder" is only one piece of being good at your job. Below are my five key takeaways for 2020.

<br />

## #1 - Good communication skills matter
In a professional setting it is critical to have good communication skills. Especially as a software engineer, where the problems are complex, it is easy for things to become "more difficult" if you are not precise in what you are saying. In the era of the COVID-19 global pandemic, **written communication** has became extremely important. 

This principle really can be applied to any job. The better a person is at communicating their issues / needs the better employee they become. 

<br />

## #2 - Writing good tests is way more important than you think
This, to me, is one of the large differentiators of what is "professional grade software" and "hobby software". A piece of software cannot be called "professional" if adequate testing standards aren't put into place. 

It is extremely important to outline your testing strategy when beginning work on a project, as testing can become a gigantic technical debt item that is a bear to handle. Yes, writing front end tests is a pain, but there is a need to have them.

This doesn't mean go full-on test-first in your code methodologies, but at the very least it should be a requirement that any "testable code" has good code coverage in a teams pull request process. 

To qualify "testable code", it is important to note that identifying what is important to test, and excluding things that aren't important to test is a **valid** test strategy, but is something that needs to be clearly outlined in coding standards.

<br />

## #3 - Be humble in your abilities
Every young professional out of college is eager to showcase their talents at their new job. Regardless how well you did in school, it is important to be humble in your abilities while starting your career. In a job like being a software engineer, there is always something to learn, and there are always gaps in your knowledge. 

Those gaps are an opportunity to grow, not a challenge to your abilities. 

<br />

## #4 - Be aware of getting stuck in your own opinions
If you are working in a technical stack that is something you are familiar with, it is important to stay aware of your own opinions and how they may affect the code base you are working in. Feel like something should be written one way but you are getting push back from your team? It is important to argue your case, but it is even more important to have a consensus on code standards and how things are written.

In the end, it is better to have an established pattern of how things are done than a multitude of different code patterns in your code base. The latter situation can happen through individual developers instilling their opinions in the application where a standard should be established. 

Imagine if a team of frontend engineers implemented and formatted the way they create forms each in their own way - that leads to unmaintainable code.

## #5 - Take your time and do it right
You may want to pick up a task and try to rip through it to impress your project manager, but it is important to be cautious in how quickly you are trying to turn around things. 

**Do things once.** Write good code carefully, and try to avoid having to go back and re-engineer snippets that are problematic only because it was rushed. In the end, it always costs more money to progress quickly and build up a large amount of tech debt, than to take your time and do it right the first time.
