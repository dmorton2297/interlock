# Devspace 2.0
Welcome to the first post I am writing for my second iteration of my technical blog, devspace. In this post, I want to provide some detail around the site I am replacing, and how I plan to use the new version. 
<br />

## A story of an old project

Back in 2019 I worked on creating a personal blogging website, devspace. My intention was to that site to document things I learned during my career. The website, in my opinion, was pretty cool. It included a profile, in app MD editing with real time rendering, users etc. For The
sake of this version dying - I am going to post a photo dump of my previous work.

**As you can tell, this website is serving as its replacement.
The reasons are pretty simple. A *$15.99 heroku bill*.**
<br />
I realize that I could have simply changed where I am hosting this project, and I still might do that. However I took this as an opportunity to start something new, and migrating a hobby project is not something I want to do in my free time.

<br />
<br />

## What went wrong and how can it can be better? 
My largest problem with my first technical blogging effort is it lacked the most important component,
posts. Retrospectively, I think this is because of the complexity that was baked
into the site. I ended up spending more time maintaining the website rather than
using it, which once again, is not something I want to do in my free time.

<br />

So how can I make this better? I started the project intending to use it as a technical blog site. One of the issues that I found was that, though cool, the in browser post editor was useless. I would always open a code editor, write my post in markdown, then post into the form.

<br />

This got be thinking about the most important part of a blogging website, and specifically a _technical_ blogging website. Text editing.

<br />

For this reason, I am returning to a simpler time in the internet, where I am server rendering pages (with some new magic with Next.js and MDX ðŸ˜‰) to get my word out there. The implementation details of this site will be detailed in a later post.
<br />
## Looking towards the future
I plan to use this site to still post technical content, but I hope to make the tone more casual and entertaining to read. I am still working on fleshing out the functionality of this website, so bare with me. My end goal is to deliver the best possible, ad free, reading experience.
