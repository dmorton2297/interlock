# Building dead simple react components.
interlock-react is is a themeable, bare bones component library. This library is intentional basic, to reinforce the difference between what should be a feature of a component library, and what should be an example composition of that component library.

# Project Goals
I started to develop interlock-react as a desire to build a design-system for a larger ambition to creating my own stack. The main goals of this initiative are to focus on minimzing dependencies, provide a good developer experience, and to build sta[able and up to date software.
